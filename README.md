Kate Perry is a text editor written in Python.

It includes writting in languages such as C, C++, Java, Python... with great highlighting and autocompletion.
The main gui will be created using PyQt4 package. 

Changing themes will probably be written in css or yaml or something like that (more info on that later...). 

For now the plan is to implement snippets for C++. If you type main, vector, list, etc. the text editor reccomends you the whole block of code with the default types or names. 

Also the plan is to have a console in the bottom so you don't have to change tabs to compile or what not. 

Kate Perry will try it's best to have custom shortcuts.
